Telethon

  ⭐️ Thanks **everyone** who has starred the project, it means a lot!

This is the threaded, simpler version of Telethon for people who
can't bother learning ``asyncio`` but wouldn't like their scripts
to just stop working. This version is also compatible with Python
3.4 but doesn't have any of the benefits of the ``asyncio`` version
and will receive updates slower.

Please consider learning ``asyncio``. The `documentation
<http://telethon.rtfd.io/>`_ is the same for both versions
of the library. Simply don't write any keywords like ``async``
or ``await`` and you will be good.
